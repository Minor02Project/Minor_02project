# Minor_02project
creating AI advertisement platform using face, gender and age detection.


This project works on artificial intelligence and also comprises some Deep Learning techniques. The project is mainly divided into two parts. In the first part of the project, the AGE and GENDER of the user will be determined by using face recognition techniques in which the user has to allow permission of the webcam. This will result in the approximately correct range of age of the user and its gender. After that, some content will be displayed to the user according to his/her age and gender. The content that will be displayed is predefined and will be stored in the backend. It includes different videos of some advertisements of the products, some educational platforms according to age, funny cartoon videos for kids, and so on. Many times, we have seen that some improper content is shown on websites and games platforms which is inappropriate for kids. So, the main purpose of our project is to correct this. We are proposing the intermediate stage of this model which can further be enhanced and can be downloaded as an extension that will automatically start after giving permissions and only the appropriate advertisements will be shown to the user.
